*Crippling or immobilizing involves the killer hitting a survivor once or twice respectively. Being crippled allows you to throw only one of the dice while being immobilised disallows you any use of dice until you are picked up to the killer and put up on a hook.
*While hooked you can throw the dice in order to achieve a total score of 30 in order to escape in a crippled state.
*While hooked you have a period of 4 turns before you bleed out and lose the game therefore being removed from the game.
*Barricades cannot be traversed by the killer. They can be destroyed by the killer in exchange for the rest of his turn.
*Healing involves a player receiving the dice back after he has been crippled or immobilised.
